# AutoEngine_v2

I decided to rewrite my game engine because my old one is a bit too messy. It is currently still in early development so there're not a lot of features.

This engine uses SDL, Glew, and stb libraries. You can get them here:

SDL: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
SDL_Image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
SDL_TTF: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
SDL_Mixer: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
SDL_Net: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
Glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net/
stb: https://github.com/nothings/stb
