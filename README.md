# AutoEngine_v2

I decided to rewrite my game engine because my old one is a bit messy. It is currently still in early development so there're not a lot of features.

This engine uses SDL, Glew, and stb libraries. You can get them here:

<ul>
  <li>SDL: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php</li>
  <li>SDL_Image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/</li>
  <li>SDL_TTF: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/</li>
  <li>SDL_Mixer: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/</li>
  <li>SDL_Net: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/</li>
  <li>Glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net/</li>
  <li>stb: https://github.com/nothings/stb</li>
</ul>
